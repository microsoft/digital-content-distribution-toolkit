# CMS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Prerequisites

To use Angular framework on your local machine, you need to install the following beforehand:

### Node.js

Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. 
+ Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for Windows by clicking the "Windows Installer" option.
+ Run the downloaded Node.js `.msi` Installer - including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install. This requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate.
+ To ensure Node.js has been installed, run `node -v` in your terminal and confirm the version installed.

### npm Package Manager

+ Update your version of npm with `npm install npm --global`. This requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate.

### Angular CLI

+ Run `git clone`<url> in the terminal of your editor to clone this repository.
+ Go to the `cd bine-crm` directory.
+ `git checkout sprint-5` and execute `cd blendnet.cms.web.ui` to work in the CMS directory.
+  Install angular CLI for this project in this directory by running the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
